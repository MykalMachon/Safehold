# Safehold 
Safehold is a location based safety app built for COMP 370 at UFV.

## What is Safehold
Have you ever felt unsafe walking back from work after a late night at the office? What about after a night of drinks with friends?  – Safehold is a reliable, and discrete application that helps you quickly and securely reach out to friends, family, and the authorities whenever you feel unsafe. 

### Easy to setup and operate
Setting up Safehold is as easy as selecting the contacts you trust with your location when you’re in trouble. Then, if you ever feel unsafe all you need to do is hold the safehold button on the main page of the app, and release it when you’re in trouble. Safehold will lock your phone, depending on your settings it might wait a few seconds, then it will send your location to your selected contacts. You can even have a safehold resend your location every minute until you say you’re safe. 

### Works wherever you have cell signal
Safehold was developed to work for the most people, in the most situations. It uses text messages to send your location to family and friends which avoids the need for a WiFi connection or even a mobile data plan.

### We care about your privacy
Safehold does ask you to fill out an optional survey after an event, however, we only take the information you give us explicit information to use. For example, we will never use your location without your permission, and even when you do give us permission to use your location, we anonymize the data (this data will be used to show dangerous locations in your surrounding area in a future update) 

*Developers Note*
This app was developed as a final project for COMP 370 at UFV. It is still in development and we would not yet recommend using it in seriously dangerous situations.
